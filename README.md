# CityWeather

This project is called CityWeather and as its name suggests, it shows you the meteo for the next 7 days, including the current one. It has been coded with C++ and includes some external libraries

# Requirements

- Linux
- Cmake
- make
- qt5

# Installation

The project uses a Cmake for installation. All the needed libraries will be installed, and some of them are imported over the internet & GitHub, so it might take a little while.

## Pre-requisite

This README assume that you already installed or have qt installed on your computer. 

As Qt can weight several GigaOctets, when installed through official installer, I prefered to let the user choose to download it, and where from, and include it in my script or in a Cmake.

I would suggest using a light version, such as the one available on your official pkg manager.

## CMake

First, place yourself in the current directory of the project.
Then, here are a few commands to compile the project :

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

## Install Script

If you prefer, you can just launch this little script who will install the binary for you and place it in the `build` folder.  Launch that command from inside the build directory.

The command is :
``` bash
./quick_install.sh
cd build
./CityWeather
```

# Librairies

I used **several** libraries for this project. 

Just installing them and compiling them from the sources was a challenge, since I had never come across a Cmake.

**Conan** and  **vcpkg** were both usable options, but configuration was time consumming, and I prefered to learn simple makefiles instead.

I used : 
- __*libcpr*__ to generate simple HTTP requests. It is well documented and highly maintained on GitHub. Feel free to check : https://github.com/libcpr/cpr
- __*nlohmann/json*__ to convert GET requests into simple json objects, without parsing them manually. This project is really well documented and also highly maintained. Github: https://github.com/nlohmann/json

# API

The 2 A.P.Is used are both part of the same provider. They are free and great to use, and can be found at https://open-meteo.com/. No API key is required and the doc is plain simple. Easy.

To make my site run, I consume 2 A.P.Is : 

1. *Open-Meteo* **GeoCoding API**, that allows me to convert a city name into latitude and longitude datas.
2. *Open-Meteo* **WeatherForecast API**, that will use my previously acquired datas of latitude and longitude to obtains meteo metrics for the next 7 days.

# Backend

I tried to heavily implement and use OOP. 

Let's take for example the classes :
 1. ApiRequester
 2. GeoCodeApi
 3. OpenMeteoApi

In this case, I created a base class `ApiRequester` to emit simple requests, and I made both class `GeoCodeApi` and `OpenMeteoApi` inherit from this class and implement their own way of managing parameters of the URL with method `addSpecificParameters()`. 

The `Get()` method is encapsulated in this class and everything is happening behind closed doors. I also included methods that allows to convert the stored responses in easily usable objects called `convertJsonResponseToMap`.

The result is not as polymorphic as I expected, but it'll do for now.

# Frontend

## gtkmm
It all started with gtkmm + Glade for UI...but it didn't do anything more than make me lose a full day.. Gtkmm is just C++ bindings of C-Gtk so it is pretty hard to use in an OOP way that allows to preserve good architecture. The documentation is pretty bad, no good tutorial...

So I switched to ...ðŸŒŸ Qt ðŸŒŸ !

## QT
Easy to use and learn, took me only 1 day to have my graphical interface binded with my datas ! Thanks to their extremly rich documentation + coverture on stackoverflow, youtube, etc... I designed the ui with QtCreator and binded the objects through pointers then populated them with data. The entire UI holds in 170 lines of code. Thanks QT !
